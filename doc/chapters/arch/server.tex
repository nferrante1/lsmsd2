\section{Server}\label{sec:server}

The server contains the core logic of the application. It receives commands from
the client, performs the required operation, and returns the result to the
client. Even administration commands are handled by the server (in this case,
sometimes, may be necessary to instruct the scraper to reload the configuration
from the database).

Strategies' code are saved in files in the file system.
