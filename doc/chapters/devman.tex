\chapter{Strategy development manual}\label{appendix:devman}

To create a new strategy, a Java class must be developed. The Java class must
be public and implement the \code{app.library.ExecutableStrategy} interface and
it must be placed in a file called \code{<ClassName>.java}. The class must be
placed in the default package.

If you want to use Eclipse IDE to develop a strategy, just create a new project
and add the \code{Server} project as a dependency. This will allow the IDE to
provide functionalities such as code completion and error checking. Place all
the strategies you develop in the default package.

The base skeleton for a strategy can be found in \code{strategies/Skel.java}.
The content is shown in~\lstref{lst:strategyskel}.

Various examples of strategies can be found in the \code{strategies} folder.
