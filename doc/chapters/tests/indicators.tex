\section{Validation of indicators' pipelines}\label{sec:indicatorsvalidation}

In the following, we will show that the aggregation pipelines developed for the
computation of the indicators (available in package
\code{app.server.libra\-ry.indicators}) are valid. To do this, we aver used a
special strategy (\code{WriteFileStrategy.java}) to write the output of the
pipeline in a file. Then, we have loaded the file in Matlab and compared the
results in the file with those computed by Matlab.
