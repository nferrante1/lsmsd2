\section{Validation of indicators' pipelines}\label{sec:indicatorsvalidation}

To assess that the computation of the indicators (available in package
\code{app.server.libra\-ry.indicators}) are valid, we have used a
special strategy (\code{WriteFileStrategy.java}) to write the output of the
pipeline in a file. Then, we have loaded the file in Matlab and compared the
results in the file with those arising from Matlab computations on raw data. Results
give us 0 error on the easier indicators, on more complex indicators such as EMA
the error is negligible and very likely depends on different approximations
performed by mongo and Matlab.
